Changes to plotmo Package
-------------------------

1.0-1 Apr 01, 2011

plotmo was printing degree1 graphs for all used earth predictors,
not just those appearing in degree1 terms.  Fixed that.

plotmo was not handling all1=TRUE correctly for earth models with
factor predictors.  Fixed that.

1.0-0 Mar 31, 2011

Initial release.  Moved plotmo from the earth 2.5-1 to here.

Changes to plotmo Package
-------------------------

--- 1.2-6 

Removed an incorrect stopifnot.integer(y.column) in get.plotmo.y.wrapper

--- 1.2-5 Jun 11, 2011

Fixed an incorrect stop when trace>0 and x had no column names.
We no longer print the plot index in the plot title when all1 or
   all2 specified but also degree1 and degree2.
Added get.plotmo.default.type.fda
Touchups to the documentation.

--- 1.2-4 Apr 27, 2011

Removed hooks for the earth package (which are no longer necessary
  with earth 2.6-2).  The file plotmo.methods.R was deleted.

Added the grid argument.

--- 1.2-3 Apr 17, 2011

This package no longer needs the earth package.  However the current
  earth (2.6-1) needs some hooks in this package to build.
  After earth 2.6-2 is on CRAN that will no longer be necessary,
  and the hooks will be removed from this package.
We now have better error reporting for bad y's.
We now have better jittering of response points with a binary response.

--- 1.2-0 Apr 12, 2011

Added ndiscrete arg (variables with a small number of levels
   are now plotted as "blocks", like factors).
Added smooth.col and related args (plotmo can add a loess line).
Made tweaks necessary because earth now imports this package.
Added dvalue and npoints args.
Added center arg (preliminary implementation).
Added basic support for lars, nnet, and knn3 models.
Jittering now works better.
We now jitter response points for factors and discrete variables by default.
plotmo is now faster:
   We cache the plot data to avoid calling predict twice for each plot
   For discrete vars and factors we only call predict for their original values
   ngrid1 is much smaller (ok to do that because of ndiscrete arg)
Better error reporting for illegal args.
Reduced the number of default colors (just grays and lightblue now).
Out-of-range values in image plots are now plotted in blue.
Fixed an issue where the wrong environment could be used.
Better error reporting for unsupported models.
Fixed handling of factors with non contiguous levels
Modified test scripts to conform to R 2.13.0's way of printing numbers
Numerous other document and code touch ups.

--- 1.0-1 Apr 01, 2011

plotmo was printing degree1 graphs for all used earth predictors,
not just those appearing in degree1 terms.  Fixed that.

plotmo was not handling all1=TRUE correctly for earth models with
factor predictors.  Fixed that.

--- 1.0-0 Mar 31, 2011

Initial release.  Moved plotmo from earth 2.5-1 to here.
